# Legal AI User Guide

Welcome to your Legal AI Assistant. This platform helps you analyze legal documents using advanced AI.

## 👥 Roles & Permissions

When you first sign up, you create a new **Organization** and become its **Admin**.

*   **Admin (You):** Can upload documents, manage the workspace, and chat.
*   **Users (Team):** (Future feature) Can chat with documents you uploaded.

## 🚀 How to Use the App

### 1. Registration (The First Step)
*   Go to the Login page.
*   Click **Register**.
*   Enter your Email, Password, and a **Company Name** (e.g., "Smith & Associates").
*   *Note: This creates your private workspace. Data is isolated from other companies.*

### 2. The Admin Workflow (Uploading Data)
Before you can chat, the AI needs to read your legal documents.
1.  Navigate to the **Documents** tab.
2.  Click **Upload Document**.
3.  **What to Upload:**
    *   **Contracts:** Employment agreements, NDAs, Service contracts.
    *   **Case Law:** PDF/Text files of court judgments.
    *   **Statutes/Regulations:** Legal acts or compliance guidelines.
4.  Wait for the status to change to **Processed**.
    *   *The AI is now "reading" and indexing your file.*

### 3. The User Workflow (Chatting)
Once documents are uploaded, anyone in your team can query them.
1.  Go to the **Chat** tab.
2.  Ask questions like:
    *   *"What is the termination clause in the Employment Agreement?"*
    *   *"Summarize the liability limits in the NDA."*
    *   *"Does this contract mention arbitration?"*
3.  The AI will answer and **cite the specific document** it used.

## 💡 Best Practices for Uploads
To get the best results:
*   **Format:** PDF or TXT files work best.
*   **Clarity:** Ensure scanned PDFs are readable (OCRed).
*   **Scope:** Upload related documents together (e.g., all contracts for a specific project).

## ❓ FAQ
*   **Why does upload take time?**
    The system splits your document into thousands of small chunks and processes them with Google Gemini to make them searchable. This happens once per document.
*   **Can others see my data?**
    No. Your data is locked to your Organization ID. Other users cannot access it.
